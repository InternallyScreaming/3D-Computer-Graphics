# 3D Computer Graphics
 A repository to host all programming assignments for 3D Computer Graphics

Intersection Finder - A Maya Python script.  Takes a plane and projects 
lines from it's vertices to origin.  If there is an object
between the plane and origin, a cube will spawn at where the invisible line
crosses on the face of the inbetween object.

Chain Generator -  This is the final project for 3D computer graphics.  
It is a Maya python script that will allow for a user 
to create a multitude of chains that either 
can follow along a bezier curve or in a straight line.

Simply open the script in the Maya script editor, and
run the code to bring up the generator UI.
